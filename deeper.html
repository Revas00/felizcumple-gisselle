  <h2>Texts I Could Never Send You. They Reveal Too Much</h2>

  <div class="text-bubble">
I wasn’t supposed to think of you this much. But some nights, I do. And I write things like this hoping they never reach you.

  <div class="text-bubble">
I think about you more than i want to admit
You slip into my thoughts like you belong here.
My body reacts to the memory of your voice and how you said that.
But there are things i can't tell you with words, only show you while i hold you.
    
I picture us, more than side by side,
moving in rhythm, While we talk, letting the pause linger.

Sometimes i imagine you here, not for visiting,
but fitting. In my space, in my arms.
Filling the silence with your sighs.

More than just being here, belonging.
Then i think about calling you mine. You being mine seems right.

The gravity of you, it pulls me closer,
even when i try to stay still. 
When i try not to feel too much.

I want you
slow,
real,
not because i need it, 
it'sbecause you feel inevitable.

I won’t say anything aloud,
not yet.
But if you watch closely,
you will see it.

  </div>

  <div class="text-bubble">
You're not mine

I know it's unfair
we barely know each other, and I don't expect anything from you.
But still,

I can’t deny there’s something unsettling
about the thought of someone else getting there faster.

It’s not about possession, or love.
And it’s not that I think I deserve it.
I don’t.    
    
Not just any flowers.
It's the kind you keep
pressed between pages,
wrapped in meaning,
trembling with the weight
of being first.

You
deserve a garden.

You deserve someone
who sees the roots,
who waters slowly,
who stays long enough
to see you open.

And I
wanted to be that hand.
not to rush you,
but to be the first
to offer something real.

No pressure, no games.
Just honesty and presence.

not to impress,
but to say:
“I see you. I waited for this.
You’re worth something that lasts.”

I’m not trying to turn this into something it’s not.
Maybe I’ll never get the chance.
Maybe it won’t be me.
But,
there’s a part of me that wishes
even if you’re not mine.
