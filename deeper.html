  <h2>Texts I Could Never Send You. They Reveal Too Much</h2>

  <div class="text-bubble">
I wasn’t supposed to think of you this much. But some nights, I do. And I write things like this hoping they never reach you.
  </div>

   <div class="text-bubble">
I love how kind, delicate you are.
There’s a softness in you, that doesn’t feel fragile
That makes me feel things I don’t yet have words for.

Because i carry something different inside.
A quiet reversal of what’s seen
in a small woman’s body.
Built more to hold than to be held.
Not confused,
just in a rhythm that doesn’t always match the surface.

I’ve never felt the need to change my body in that sense,
it wouldn’t be able to give me anything that lacks me.

I don’t expect you to understand.

Sometimes i step back before I speak,
I may hide my ache behind a serious face 
None of this makes me bitter.
If anything, it’s made me softer.

i expect nothing back.
I don’t ask for anything.
not reassurance,
not even space in your world.

I just want you to know,
what's beneath the surface.
Why it can feel a little distant,
and why words arrive too slow.
I’ve learned to carry quietly what most don’t see.
And protect what matters.
  </div>
  
  <div class="text-bubble">
I think about you more than i want to admit
You slip into my thoughts like you belong here.
How my body reacts to the memory of your voice and how you said that.
There are things i can't tell you with words, only show you while i hold you.
    
I picture us, more than side by side,
moving in rhythm, when we talk, when we let the pause linger.

Sometimes i imagine you here, not for visiting,
but fitting. In my space, in my arms.
Filling the silence with your breathing.

More than just being here, belonging.
Then i think about calling you mine. You being mine seems right.

The gravity of you, it pulls me closer,
even when i try to stay still. 
When i try not to feel too much.

The way i want you
slow,
deliberate,
not for ownership, 
because you feel inevitable.

I won’t say anything aloud,
not yet.
But if you watch closely,
you will see it.

  </div>

  <div class="text-bubble">
You're not mine

I know it's unfair
we barely know each other, and I don't expect anything from you.
But still,

I can’t deny there’s something unsettling
about the thought of someone else getting there faster.

It’s not about possession, or love.
And it’s not that I think I deserve it.
I don’t.    
    
Not just any flowers.
It's the kind you keep
pressed between pages,
wrapped in meaning,
trembling with the weight
of being first.

You
deserve a garden.

You deserve someone
who sees the roots,
who waters slowly,
who stays long enough
to see you open.

And I
wanted to be that hand.
not to rush you,
but to be the first
to offer something real.

No pressure, no games.
Just honesty and presence.

not to impress,
but to say:
“I see you. I waited for this.
You’re worth something that lasts.”

I’m not trying to turn this into something it’s not.
Maybe I’ll never get the chance.
Maybe it won’t be me.
But,
there’s a part of me that wishes
even if you’re not mine.
